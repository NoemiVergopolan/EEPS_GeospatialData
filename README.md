## Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
This course provides a comprehensive foundation in computational tools and machine learning techniques for exploring geospatial data-driven insights across disciplines. Students will develop key skills in Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning, applying these techniques to large and complex datasets in areas like climate, hydrology, and remote sensing. Through hands-on assignments and projects, students will learn to handle multi-dimensional data, visualize patterns, and perform statistical, spatial, and machine learning analyses to address real-world environmental challenges.

## Texts and Materials
Readings will be assigned from various sources and provided during the course.

## Course Evaluation
This course will not have a traditional exam but will include participation requirements, 5 homework assignments, a 1-page project proposal, a final project paper, and a final project presentation. 

### Final Project
A major component of the grade will come from the independent project, which students should begin thinking about and meet with the instructor to discuss early in the semester. The topic will be of the student’s choosing based on the student’s interest or curiosity. It may be related to research by the student, but it should constitute a self-contained project leveraging the tools introduced in the class. Students will submit a proposal, presentations will be given in the last week of class, and an ~8-10 page term paper will summarize the project. For graduate students, the final project should be motivated by strong scientific research questions and provide rigorous data analysis using advanced methods introduced in the class. The final project report will be evaluated in terms of its novelty and quality, which should be comparable to a peer-reviewed scientific article. As such, the final project paper will carry a large weight on graduate students' grading.
